# Employee App JS

This project is a web application for managing employees made with LitElement.

This project includes a sample component using LitElement with JavaScript.

This template is generated from the `lit-starter-js` package in [the main Lit
repo](https://github.com/lit/lit). Issues and PRs for this template should be
filed in that repo.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

Serve to http://localhost:8000:

```bash
npm run serve
```

## Testing

This sample modern-web.dev's
[@web/test-runner](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web/test-runner) for testing. See the
[modern-web.dev testing documentation](https://modern-web.dev/docs/test-runner/overview) for
more information.

Tests can be run with the `test` script, which will run your tests against Lit's development mode (with more verbose errors) as well as against Lit's production mode:

```bash
npm test
```

For local testing during development, the `test:dev:watch` command will run your tests in Lit's development mode (with verbose errors) on every change to your source files:

```bash
npm test:watch
```

Alternatively the `test:prod` and `test:prod:watch` commands will run your tests in Lit's production mode.

## Dev Server

This sample uses modern-web.dev's [@web/dev-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web/dev-server) for previewing the project without additional build steps. Web Dev Server handles resolving Node-style "bare" import specifiers, which aren't supported in browsers. It also automatically transpiles JavaScript and adds polyfills to support older browsers. See [modern-web.dev's Web Dev Server documentation](https://modern-web.dev/docs/dev-server/overview/) for more information.

To run the dev server and open the project in a new browser tab:

```bash
npm run serve
```

## Static Site

This project includes a simple website generated with the [eleventy](https://11ty.dev) static site generator and the templates and pages in `/docs-src`. The site is generated to `/docs` and intended to be checked in so that GitHub pages can serve the site [from `/docs` on the main branch](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site).

To enable the site go to the GitHub settings and change the GitHub Pages &quot;Source&quot; setting to &quot;main branch /docs folder&quot;.</p>

To build the site, run:

```bash
npm run docs
```

To serve the site locally, run:

```bash
npm run docs:serve
```

To watch the site files, and re-build automatically, run:

```bash
npm run docs:gen:watch
```

The site will usually be served at http://localhost:8000.

**Note**: The project uses Rollup to bundle and minify the source code for the docs site and not to publish to NPM. For bundling and minification, check the [Bundling and minification](#bundling-and-minification) section.

## Bundling and minification

As stated in the [static site generation](#static-site) section, the bundling and minification setup in the Rollup configuration in this project is there specifically for the docs generation.

We recommend publishing components as unoptimized JavaScript modules and performing build-time optimizations at the application level. This gives build tools the best chance to deduplicate code, remove dead code, and so on.

Please check the [Publishing best practices](https://lit.dev/docs/tools/publishing/#publishing-best-practices) for information on publishing reusable Web Components, and [Build for production](https://lit.dev/docs/tools/production/) for building application projects that include LitElement components, on the Lit site.
